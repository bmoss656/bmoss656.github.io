So, we got our assignment brief for the second game we have to create at the end of last week. My initial thoughts are, "How the hell do I make this game?" since we're using the 'Awesome sauce game engine' which none of us are familiar with at all. The core concept of the game hopefully should be okay once I breakdown the components of the game. I'm also a bit nervous about using git as a way of version control because I have no experience using it before and it is a little daunting compared to the usual saving as a new file method of backups...

Essentially the game involves moving a snake around a grid to eat squares in order to make your snake bigger. The more squares you eat, the higher your score. This is something of a classic game and one that most people (Even people with limited gaming experience) have played. But how can I make the game more interesting than just a snake clone? My initial thoughts about changes for the game involve adding a difficulty/lives system to the game so potentially I need to work out a way to make the game more challenging while still trying to keep that classic snake feel.



#### Possible Changes
- Add a difficulty scale
- Add lives depending on difficulty 
- Adjustable grid size 
- Hazards that you have to avoid 
- Obstacles that move?
- Local multiplayer? 



#### Final Thoughts

So overall, I'm slightly worried about making this game just because at the same time I will need to be familiarising myself with how the new engine works. Plus the game is due in about a month so I will be making a start over the next couple of days and will have hopefully made some progress by the weekend.
