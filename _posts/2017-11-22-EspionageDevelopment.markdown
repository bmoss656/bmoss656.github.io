#### Development of Espionage

Our game is coming along well and progressing rather fast, there are several features that we are changing quite rapidly in order to shape our game. One of the main features/mechanics of our game is now the solving of cases. This feature mostly came about from the whole group rather than one person, it was the combination of our ideas that led us to having solvable cases, these cases now play a pivotal role in our game. There are several other features that we have added that I will talk about here.

#### Cases
Essentially 5 cases will appear over a 6 turn period, these cases will have locations and a solve cost on, and you have to move to the location it says on the card and have the required resources in order to solve a case. At the moment cases reward you with credits but ultimately do nothing in terms of progressing the game, which is an issue we are currently struggling with. An idea that I have which I will bring up next time we are making changes to our game is something along the lines of occasionally having a much harder to solve case drawn instead of the usual cases and solving one of these will help you win the game. However the only problem with this is that it doesn’t quite fit in with the theme of the rest of the game, of knowing when things are going to happen but not exactly when- the previous idea I mentioned is seemingly random so goes against this somewhat.

Another interesting mechanic that we have added into our game is this idea of premonition and it sort of now is one of the major selling points of our game. The mechanic is that each player looks at one of the next 5 cases and then places them back on the top of the deck. This allows each player to know one of the next 5 cases but they do not know when it will occur, this adds for some interesting gameplay we found, as you can sometimes tell what case might be coming up next by reading your opponents gameplay. This adds an element of strategy to the game because you have to plan ahead for this case you know is going to happen without giving it away to another player which we found was a very interesting mechanic. This mechanic came about from iterative play testing essentially, we were playing and it dawned on me that our game wasn’t actually fitting our theme of espionage very well, which is then when we came up with the idea. The image below shows one of our recent playtests.

#### Iteration 

With each play test our game heads closer towards being a finished product and becomes a little bit more refined. Iteration is something we have found to be very useful and being able to change and add rules for our game mid-playtest is something that has been invaluable, it makes it so we are able to isolate what works and what doesn’t rapidly and efficiently, which leads to us being able to try more features and mechanics out which in turn will hopefully lead to a better created game.

I personally feel that the cases are a large part of what I’ve contributed to the group, we had the initial idea of them together and then I refined it and came back to the group with what I had. We then created a design for the case card and I personally made them unique and attempted to balance them enough for gameplay by adding the right locations and resource requirements on each card. I think the cases are a staple of our game and I’m proud to have helped contribute to them. The image below shows our most recent play test including case cards.
