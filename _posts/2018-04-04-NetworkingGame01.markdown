#### Networking Game

We have been given our final game for the LLP module and of course because of it being the final game of the year, it is the most complex one yet. The difference between this game and the other ones we had to create is that this one must contain networking. This is a new concept for me and I have no prior experience with any form of networking, so it may be slightly challenging however I’m looking forward to gaining some experience with networking.

#### First Steps

This game is another group project and I will be working with the same group as before, this comes with some positives and negatives, but it does mean that we were able to quickly start discussing ideas for our game. The game we create must contain networking and has to be turn based but within those guidelines we have free rein in terms of the actual game we create. 

As a group we decided upon our idea for our game which we have given the placeholder name ‘Project Horde’ (which I’m sure will end up sticking). Our game will be a co-op zombie survival game, loosely based around another video game called ‘House of the Dead’. In House of the Dead, you progress forward killing as many zombies and other monsters as you can along the way, we will be taking this mechanic and modifying it to work in a turn-based fashion. The game will consist of progressing from one side of a map to another, saving survivors and killing zombies along the way. For this project, the networking is more important than the amount of gameplay we have, so we’re going to try and aim to have a short but polished example of our gameplay with smooth networking implemented.

#### Where Next?

The first task for our game is to start looking at networking and implementing a system that allows us to easily transfer packets of data across a network. Another member of my group ([Nathan](https://n86-64.github.io/blog/)) prefers to focus on the technical side of implementation so he will be taking the lead on the networking aspect and I will be providing assistance where need be as well as starting to look at implementing some of the gameplay.
