#### It’s All Over

The deadline for our networking game, which we officially titled ‘Deadlock’, was this morning so for better or for worse our game is finished. Unfortunately, we were unable to get the game to a state that we were happy with, but we are out of time and we tried the best we could within our situation. I’ll discuss the overall project below.

#### Final Game

So, our final game didn’t quite end up being the exciting, enjoyable game that we hoped it to be, instead what we finished up with was a somewhat lacking project from a gameplay point of view with most of the features we planned to implement not making it in, and in fact our game unfortunately doesn’t properly work over the network which is a shame. 

The game itself consisted of being able to move around a grid and attack zombies, pretty basic but our situation limited us. We attempted to make our gameplay work over a networked system but ran out of time to implement it effectively. We finished a lobby and a ready up system, however that is as far as the networking goes, as it doesn’t transmit information about the game across the network unfortunately.

Some parts of the UI were also greatly lacking as one member of the team was responsible for finding and creating us some good looking artwork, however we were slightly let down and we did not receive everything we wanted. The final version of the game can be seen in my portfolio section but a short gif below gives an idea.

#### Finishing Thoughts

There was a few contributing factors towards us not being able to totally finish the networking aspect of the game and I’ll briefly discuss them here and the project in general.

A main issue was the team I was with. One member worked very hard and contributed a lot of work to the project and dealt with a large amount of the networking. Another member however contributed zero code towards the project and let us down in regards to some parts of the UI. This effectively left us as a two-person group and the project was too much for two people to handle in my opinion, especially considering most groups were made up of four people and the fact that I had mentioned my concerns about this group prior to the project start. It seemed unfair to me the way our group was handled, especially considering other groups were changed but its over with now, however it’s just hard not to think about how the project would have gone if we’d had a different team.

Myself and my team mate working as hard as we could on the project, working non-stop on it over this weekend and practically not sleeping to try and get it finished- another couple of pairs of hands on the project would have helped. 

On a more personal note, I unfortunately couldn’t be perhaps as effective as I would have liked to be over the last week. This was due to having multiple pieces of coursework due which meant I was putting extra time in them to cover the lack of work from other teammates in those projects too, as well as over the last week suffering head pain ranging from mild to quite severe and debilitating which effected how productive I was able to be, and a lack of sleep from spending so many hours on the project did not help.

Overall, I would have liked the project to have run a lot smoother with all team members putting in a more equal share of the work which would have allowed more of the features we wanted to make it in, as well as us having the networking component working more effectively. I however am proud of the work I put in and tried the best I could given the unfortunate combination of setbacks.
