#### Moving Forward

Since my last post about our Birdman game, we have made a fair amount of progress on our game idea. We fleshed out the core mechanics of the game and we pitched our idea which was then ‘greenlit’, giving us the go ahead to start actual implementation of the game.

#### Core Mechanics and Idea

The genre of the game as I discussed last time is that of a beat em up, we then took this idea and decided to make the theme of the game based around inner conflict and the idea of battling with one’s demons. Our game is going to have multiple levels each one with a different emotional theme. 

The actual mechanics of our game are going to be simple yet enjoyable to play. The core loop of the game will consist of selecting a level from the level hub and during the level you will battle waves of enemies before progressing onto the next area. The combat will be relatively simple to start with, with the player having a couple of attacks they can do but we may take this further and add combos if we have the time.

#### Thinking About Implementation

So, we now had our game idea so we decided to start thinking about how we were going to actually code our game. We discussed some basic elements such as how we would handle scene management and how input would be taken in from not just the keyboard but we also wanted gamepad support too, we will be meeting up again soon in order to hopefully create a UML diagram and finish our planning so that we can then move onto creating our game.
