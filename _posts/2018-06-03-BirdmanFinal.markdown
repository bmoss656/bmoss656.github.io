#### Finished Game

It’s been a couple of weeks since I last did an update on our Birdman game ‘Sentire’ and we have now finished our game. The deadline was the 5th of march which was yesterday, below I’ll talk about how the game went and what our finished game was like.

#### Sentire

I’ll start with a couple of hurdles we had in the group. The first one was perhaps a miscommunication issue, but one task that was delegated to a team member was not completed on time and therefore some compromises had to be made gameplay wise in order to get the game ready in time. This was unfortunate because over the last few days I was hoping to polish up the player gameplay and improve the overall feel of the gameplay but wasn’t able to do this in the end, and given more time I would have spent it on tweaking the gameplay so that the game was more enjoyable to play. However overall our codebase was probably the best part of our game as a fair amount of time was spent implementing the different components and systems and had we not had the slight issues near the end of the project, we would have had a really good game. A screenshot below shows an example of what the core game looked like.

#### To Sum It Up

My contribution to our game consisted mainly of player gameplay and logic, as well as implementing the input manager that incorporated gamepad support for our game. I also was mostly responsible for creating the enemies in the game,  which relied on basic ai and were not exactly how we planned them out, this is primarily due to the fact that I was not actually supposed to be working on the enemies but had to take over that part of the project in order to get it finished in time for our deadline.

To conclude this project, I am very happy with the structure behind our game but obviously the major part of the game for everyone excluding the developers is the gameplay. Unfortunately for us, many of the features we wanted to include got left out due to time constraints and the overall feel of the gameplay could still use some work, but that’s not to say our work was all for nothing. Our game was successful, it had a hub world for level selection and I’d prefer to call it more of a demo than a full game, since the gameplay was fairly limited, but I think it showed great potential for where we could take it.
