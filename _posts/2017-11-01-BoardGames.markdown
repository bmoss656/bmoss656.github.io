#### Initial Thoughts

We were given our theme to create our own table top game last week, the theme being a current social, political, or economic issue. This is quite a broad theme and there are many different ways that you could approach it. The first thing we did as a group was just go through all the different ideas for games that we could initially think of, this was our initial list.

- Border checkpoint		  	      
- Journalism risk			        
- Espionage				              
- Take down leader			       
- Race to be eco 			          
- Doomsday game 			         
- Nuclear bluffing game 		  	
- Space exploration tycoon	
- Generic business economy 
- Become governor game 
- City builder with eco theme
- Arms dealership game 
- Mercenary game 
- Escape a nation game 
- Diplomat game 
- World war 3 
 
We all contributed to this list and we could have continued to grow it but we liked some of the ideas that we had so for now we decided to flesh out some of our preferred ideas and then come back and continue to add more ideas if none of the others worked out. Some of our ideas were slightly generic so the 3 games we initially liked the idea of and decided to grow upon were Border checkpoint, Journalism risk and Espionage. We took each one and broke it down a bit more in depth to see if we would be able to make a fun game out of the topic/concept. 

#### Main Ideas

To start with we looked at border checkpoint, so the main idea behind this game was to do with smuggling contraband between countries, this is something that happens regularly to varying degrees of severity. For the basic concept of the game we had the idea of having one player play as a checkpoint officer while the rest tried to get goods past them via social interactions mainly focusing on bluffing which would have been the core mechanic behind the game. We liked this idea but quickly realised the game would struggle with two players and since we are trying to make a game for 2 or 4 players, this was no good.

We then moved on to the Journalism game, the idea for this game came from thinking about all the different news sources out there and how they differ from each other. The core concept of the game played similarly to risk, there was going to be a world map and each player would control a news company which would allow them to place journalists around the world to gain stories depending on different situations that may have happened from drawn cards. The game would have had integrity and money as the currencies/win conditions, so you could gain integrity depending on the way you manged the company and handled situations. We liked this idea but found that it didnâ€™t require much interaction between players and may not have been particularly engaging for players, so we kept it as on option we may come back to.

The third game from our list we looked at was the espionage game, this came from more of the idea of the mechanics of the game rather than a current issue but with all the terror and corruption the world faces we realised that we would be able to link it back to more relevant issues. The mechanics of this game revolve around taking down a corrupt organisation by managing your agents on the game board to gain intel and resources which could aid you in doing this. There would be side issues and threats that could be dealt with or ignored along the way that could cause you to gain or lose resources. We realised there were lots of ways we could go with the game and there were many ways we could add multiple layers of depth and strategy to it beneath the core idea.

We decided to focus on the espionage game for now as we felt that it had the most potential out of our ideas so far and was the one that could be the most enjoyable to play whilst sticking to the brief we had. The next step for us was to do some research around our idea and begin to break down the mechanics so we knew how the game would actually feel to play.
