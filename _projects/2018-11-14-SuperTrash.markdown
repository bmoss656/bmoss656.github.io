#### Super Trash Heroes

During my third year at university on the module Commercial Games Development I had the opportunity to work on an already existing IP, Super Trash Heroes, created by PlayWest. As a team of five, we were able to work on this game for two weeks, with the option to either create an entirely new concept using the Super Trash Assets or add on the existing game in order to improve it. My team chose to add on to the existing game and create a new game mode, this meant working within an already existing code base which came with some challenges involving poor coding standards and complicated scripts. 

We overcame the challenges however and created a PVP game mode that focused on players competing against each other to get recyclable items into their trucks. The game was received well when we play-tested it with most people enjoying the competitive nature of the game mode we added. The game did have a few bugs however that limited it somewhat and some more time was needed in order to polish the game up.
