#### The Assignment
During my first year at university, one of the modules that we did was called 3D game environments. This module involved learning some of the essentials of 3D modelling and creating 3D environments for games to take place in. One of our first assignments for this module was to create a fully functioning orrery using the Autodesk software Maya which had to be ‘powered’ by the presence of a gear system. The assignment involved modelling all of our assets from scratch, creating our own animations and creating a suitable light source for the scene.  The images above show what my final orrery looked like once completed and rendered.
