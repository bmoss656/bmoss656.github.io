#### Creating Snake

Snake is a classic game that almost everyone has played, its simplicity is its selling point but is also what limits the replayability of the game. During my second year at university we were given the assignment of creating and improving upon snake. We created the game within a custom game engine called ASGE which was created using some of the OpenGL libraries. The ASGE engine uses C++ for its language which I am familiar with, however I had no prior experience with this game engine so had to teach myself how to use it whilst creating the game. There was limited documentation to learn from so I had to familiarise myself with the engine based solely on the header files included and my previous C++ experience. I was quite happy with the finished game I created, I added levels into the game which increased in difficulty as you progressed through them as well as adding additional obstacles you had to avoid which I felt increased the users experience of the game. You can read more about the project from my dev diaryâ€™s in the blog section of my website.
