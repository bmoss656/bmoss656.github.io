#### Runner Game

During my second year at university, during my low-level programming module we created 5 games throughout the year, the second game that we were tasked with creating was an endless runner game. In its nature, an endless runner game is very simple as the underlying mechanics stereotypically donâ€™t have a huge amount of depth. However a key component of the game we had to create was that it had to contain procedural generation. I had no prior experience with this, but went away and learned some of the basics so that I was able to have the level in my runner game indefinitely procedurally generated along with the obstacles along the way. I was happy with the finished product I created, as I was still familiarising myself with the engine (ASGE) that we had to use. There were a few extra details I would have added given more time such as a level selection screen and multiple levels, but overall I thought I had created an enjoyable game.
