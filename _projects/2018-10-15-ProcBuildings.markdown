#### Building Generation Tool

A video showing the tool can be found here: https://youtu.be/PXA18nDiamA

During a third-year module, advanced technologies, I was assigned with the task to create a tool within DirectX11 that could allow a user to generate buildings and export these buildings into Unity. This was my first time using DirectX which meant there was quite a steep learning curve at the beginning of the project but once this was overcome, the tool was created quite quickly.

Creating the tool involved, setting up the basic DirectX application, rendering 3D geometry to the screen, setting up UI for the user and writing a custom exporter that allowed the geometry to be written out to a .obj file so that it could be used within other software, for example the exported buildings can be dragged straight into a Unity project.
