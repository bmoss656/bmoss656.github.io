#### Dialogue System
During my second year of university, I was tasked with creating a dialogue system within two game engines. I chose to use Unreal and Unity to create my system, I started by creating a base very simple system within Unreal and then expanded upon this in order to create a more dynamic system that could be used in some sort of RPG game. I unfortunately did not have enough time to fully finish the UI for the Unreal version of the system, meaning it could have looked more visually pleasing but it worked effectively.

For the Unity version of the system, I had a bit more experience from already creating the first system which led me to making a slightly more robust and visually pleasing system. I created a dialogue system that was dynamic and could be read in from text files that had unique formatting in order to help with implementation. Overall, I created two systems that worked effectively and I could potentially use them in later projects if necessary.
