#### Kachiku 64
A third-year module called commercial games development allowed the entire cohort to work on an a pre-existing IP, the game Kachiku64 that was developed by PlayWest, UWEâ€™s internal games studio. Kachiku64 is an ambitious game that can have up to 64 players on the screen at once competing to be the last one left alive, it takes a lot of inspiration from Bomber-man.

The game was not finished by PlayWest and many of the systems were not fully complete, we as a year group were tasked with finishing off/improving upon what was already created in order to make a more fleshed out and functional version of the game. The cohort simulated a games studio by breaking off into teams and working on several different aspects of the game such as controls, gameplay and UI, to name a few. My team chose to focus on adding a new gameplay element to the game, crop-dusters/planes. This meant coding an entirely new control system, gameplay system for the in-air behaviour and balancing the new mechanic to work with the rest of the game. I was the technical lead for this project which meant I did the majority of the coding of the behaviour of the crop-dusters.

There were some challenges from working as an entire cohort of nearly 40 people, but it gave me great experience of what working in a games studio would be like and the finished product that we managed to create was a polished well working game that we would go on to demo in front of many people at the university.
