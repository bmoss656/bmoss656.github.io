#### Soft-body Physics

As the third and final task of my third-year module advanced technologies, we were tasked with creating a destruction physics system. I chose to focus specifically on soft-body physics and created a system within Unity that allowed 3D objects to be deformed. I built the system with vehicles in mind, so the system I created is best utilised in combination with a 3D vehicle. The system allows objects to be deformed by collisions and for vehicles, different parts of the vehicles can be detached through a health system I made that can be applied to the different parts. 

As part of this system I also created a volume preservation demo. The volume preservation script that I wrote can be applied to 3D geometry and allows the object to keep its size and shape whilst being deformed. This means that objects do not get deformed into a barely recognisable shape which helps with the realism of the system.

A video of the system in action can be seen here:  [YouTube Link](https://youtu.be/EpGM7WQ9B_s)
