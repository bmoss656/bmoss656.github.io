#### Shadow of Atari

Shadow of Atari is a de-make of Shadow of the Colossus made within Unity. It was made as part of a university game jam that required the teams to choose a modern successful game and de-make it into a game that looked like it was made for the Atari-2600. This meant capturing the core parts of the game that made Shadow of the Colossus so recognisable yet making sure it was limited to the same colour scheme and other limitations that a 2600 game would have had, including a limited amount of controls. 

The game was made within a team of five people, my main role was coding the playerâ€™s behaviour as well as creating and coding the behaviour for the boss/colossus. The game we created within the limited time we had worked well as an Atari 2600 de-make, it looked as if it was 2600 game and we managed to capture the core parts of Shadow of the Colossus that made it great. This was proved to us when we presented the game to our third-year peers and most instantly recognised the game as a Shadow of the Colossus de-make.
