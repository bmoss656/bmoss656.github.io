#### Terrorformars

As another university held game jam, we were tasked with creating a 3D game according to a randomly generated game theme. The theme we received was “A horror game where you taunt tunnels by terraforming”. We struggled with the concept for our game at first, with different members of the team all having different thoughts about how we could take it, we ended up with a game that involved escaped procedurally generated tunnels using oxygen tanks to destroy the environment so they could navigate through properly to the exit before the tunnel system flooded with water.

The game we created was rather basic but since it was for a game jam, we were mainly focusing on the core aspects of the game and spent perhaps too long creating the procedural system. The game had a few bugs such as animations that could have been improved upon, but it did actually prove to be a successful horror game as it provided a good sense of fear as the water slowly rises as you rush to escape and begin to panic.
