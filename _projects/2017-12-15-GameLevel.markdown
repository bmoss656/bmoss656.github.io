#### Game Level

A module in my second year at university was called ‘Game Level Design’ and it focused on the idea that we should be able to design fun interactive game levels. The core of the module was planning and creating a singular level that focused on escaping from some sort of space station in Unreal Engine 4 (UE4). Before we started making the level however, we also had to create a full level design document that we could refer to when creating the level. Before this module I had almost no experience using UE4 but once it was finished I had a very good grasp on most key components of the engine and a good knowledge of how their blueprint system worked. I received 72% for the creation of my game level and I felt that the finished product that I had created was a very enjoyable experience to play and it had helped me gather a good knowledge of UE4.
