#### Deep Learning Game Generation
My third year of university involved a module called Advanced Technologies, this was one of the more challenging yet rewarding modules that I undertook. It involved three tasks, each task was broken down into three options that we could choose from and essentially helped me form a wide range of skills using different technology that I would not usually. One of the tasks I chose to do was this one that focused on deep learning. Before this, I had heard about deep/machine learning but did not know much about it, however by the time I had finished I had created my own neural network which can detect and make accurate guesses against different images. I created this using python, a language that I had not used before yet within 4 weeks had a good understanding of it and was able to write my neural network with the help of TensorFlow.

I took my neural network and implemented it within Unity, you could call the network I had written in python in order to guess against images, mini-games would then be generated according to what the image showed. For example, if the image was of a plane flying over a city, then a game would be generated of a plane with a city backdrop. I also expanded upon my network to include webcam support, meaning you could show it a real life object and it was able to make guesses and generate games against the webcam image. A good example of this is if I held up a ‘fingergun’ it would then generate a game involving a gun! This project gave me a very good understanding of deep learning and also taught me how to use Python, I was very happy with what I created at the end of it.
