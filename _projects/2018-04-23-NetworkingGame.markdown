#### Deadlock Group Project

For the final game in the low-level programming module in my second year of university, we were tasked in a group with creating a networked game. The basic mechanics our game needed were given to us, it was to be an RTS game which was turn based and multiplayer over the network. The theme and rest of the game was all up to us. We decided to make a co-operative game in which players would work together to complete missions, the theme of the game was based around zombies and survivors, so the main goal would be saving as many survivors while making your way across the map and attacking zombies. We figured a co-op game would suit the networked component well, as would easily allow for dropping in and out during missions- we also agreed it would be slightly different to most RTS games that you would commonly think of when trying to create a game like this.

As for the actual project, we did struggle with the actual final implementation of the game. With many of the features we planned to be in the game, unfortunately not making it into our demo. The main networking component that would allow gameplay between two clients also was lacking and unfortunately was not exactly what we wanted from our finished demo. We had some issues within our team, with us essentially only having two people working on the project which caused us to struggled with making a polished final project. The final project we did end with however was not all bad, we had most of the elements that we needed for a short bit of gameplay and all of the technical networking was in place ready to be used, we just ran out of time due to the lack of hours between only two of us to bring all the components together. Overall the project could have gone much better, however we did end up with a solid almost game engine that we would be able to build from quickly and easily in the future.
